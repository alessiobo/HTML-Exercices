        <h1>American Staffordshire Terrier or Amstaff</h1>

          <h2>Character</h2>
          <p>His stubborn and courageous temperament makes him a good dog to defend his family and prevent intruders from approaching. However he is also affectionate and docile and manages to live well at home.</p>
          <p>Education and training must be firm since a puppy: he tends to dominate by his nature, so he needs to be made to understand who the master is. He's an unpredictable dog at times, so don't take him for a walk without a leash: he could attack other dogs and get into trouble.  </p>

          <p>He certainly needs to move every day, he's not a dog that loves to sleep in an armchair. He needs to keep himself active and always busy by exercising. He tends to prefer only one master, but becomes attached to all members of the family.</p>
